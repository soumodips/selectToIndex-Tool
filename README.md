Hi! Glad you visited. This is a utility tool for downloading indexes of words in a paragraph by just selecting the words one after the other. Download a JSON output.
This project has a very specific utility and thats because it was made to automate a step at work. Uploading anyways since sharing is caring!! ;)

Steps to run: 
1. Clone or download zip for the repo.
2. Grab a cookie.
3. Open index.html
